\section{Conditional Compilation}

Conditional compilation is achieved by assigning known phrases to the Defines environment variable in the PowerShell script that compiles the program (e.g. b1.ps1). Conditional compilation with the REPORT keyword enables all the calls to the R(string) method in code. Reporting is responsible for both, outputting the messages to terminal where the program was started and outputting them to a file called report.txt in the Fluid folder.

\section{Compiling The Seminar With Tex}

To compile the seminar: Put bibliography.bib from Fluid/Tex/ somewhere along the BibLatex search path and put SeminarPreamble.tex somewhere along LaTex compiler (TexLive, MikTex) search path.
