<p>I'm coming up only to hold you under,
and coming up only to show you wrong,
and to know you is hard, we wonder,
to know you all wrong, we warn.</p>
<p>Really to late to call, so we wait for,
morning to wake you, is all we got.
To know me as hardly golden,
is to know me all wrong, they warn.</p>
<p>At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral,
at every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral,
at every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral,
at every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral.</p>
<p>I'm coming up only to show you down for,
and coming up only to show you wrong,
to the outside the dead leaves laid on the lawn,
b'fore they died and had trees to hang there'pon.</p>
<p>At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral,
at every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral,
at every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral,
at every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral.</p>
