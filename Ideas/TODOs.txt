Less important TODOs:
1)  Tensor: Create derived EmptyTensor and override its methods properly. This is to avoid reliance on null.
2)  Numerics.FuncEvaluator: Build an adaptive evaluator that samples functions based on local slope.
3)  Tensor tests: Log timing of methods for a large number of operations and save results.
