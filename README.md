# Fluid (only a blank window for now, WIP)

Unfinished project. Not in working order. Fluid is written in C# and built upon .Net Core 3.1.

## Recommended Setup

1. Install the latest [.Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Install [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
3. Install the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor.
4. Install the Powershell extension from within VS Code.
5. Clone the [Fluid](https://github.com/Marko-Petek/Fluid) repository from GitHub.
6. Open the file *Fluid.code-workspace* in VS Code. 

## Build

Use PS to build the code. Navigate PS to top folder (Fluid) and run the script **bReport.ps1**, as seen on my screen:

    /home/marko/Fluid> ./bReport.ps1

## Run

Navigate PS to top folder (Fluid) and run the script **rUI.ps1**, as seen on my screen:

    /home/marko/Fluid> ./rUI.ps1
